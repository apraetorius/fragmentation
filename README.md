# fragmentation

This repository contains the Python 3 code used to derive fragmentation rate constants (k_frag and k_frag-all) from fitting experimental fragmentaiton data as used in the manuscript "Environmental Degradation of Microplastics: How to Measure Fragmentation Rates to Secondary Micro- and Nanoplastic Fragments and Dissociation into Dissolved Organics", by Pfohl et al. 2022 (https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.2c01228). 

The data used and the fitting results can be foudn in SI Table 7 (Supporting Information) of the above-mentioned manuscript.

The code was written by Antonia Praetorius and Prado Domercq.
